The Interactive company wants to achieve a connection with this project
special between player and pet, through an experience that
foster a sense of belonging, teaching care habits and
bring love to your pet. At the same time, learn to unwind and play
in strategy with people from anywhere in the world, winning
fighting, experience, competitiveness and getting stronger
your pet.

The game is developed from the cell phone screens, where we will see
pets that we have acquired and we will have to interact with them,
not only for care and healthy growth, but also for
make it stronger and stronger.
Every day we must carry out achievements and missions that will be presented
randomly, whether it's playing certain mini games, going up to a certain level,
buy toys, etc.
We will see 3D pets with augmented reality, for greater
immersion, these pets will act depending on the needs and
the player must respond to them in order to keep optimal
careful, just like a real pet.
Initially we will have 1 pet, the screen will show us 4 eggs
of different elements (Air, Water, Earth and Fire), then, so that
our pet differs from that of other owners, we can change
the primary, secondary skin color and the color of your eyes once
Let's do this, it cannot be changed, unless you want to buy
for a modification.

The system will ask us where to put our pet through a
previous scan, since it is important to know where there will be collisions
around.
The more we interact with our pets, the more
opportunity to level up experience, improve values
fight and be the best at having the best strongest pets.
Our pet will never die, but if we neglect for too long,
they will get sick and we will have to carry out many activities to
keep it full of care.
We will have events where there will be a time limit to gather people
with your pets, in certain parts of every city in the world and fight
in playoffs to get new pets, players too
They will have battles (Friendly, Ranked and 3v3).
